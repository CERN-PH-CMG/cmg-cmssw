% 2. **DO NOT use %** to comment out sections of the abstract: the extractor will still grab those lines (and they won't be comments any longer!).

\abstract{
We summarize our contribution to the search for the Higgs boson in the high mass range ($m_H>$200~GeV/c$^2$)
using the CMS detector and the proton-proton collision data acquired in the 2011 run at a center-of-mass energy of 7~TeV.
The decay channel $H\rightarrow VV\rightarrow 2l2\nu$ where V is a vector boson (W or Z) is considered in the dilepton mass range of 76 to 106 GeV/c$^2$.
A dedicated event selection is outlined with the main purposes of
reducing the instrumental background resulting from the mismeasurement of missing transverse energy and exploring the kinematics of the Higgs events. 
In our search no excess is observed in data with respect to the Standard Model predictions
as well as in the presence of a sequential fourth family of high mass fermions
or in the fermiophobic Higgs decay scenario.
Limits are set for the production of the Higgs boson in each one of the referred contexts.
