This tutorial assumes you have a set of files:

MC1.root MC1.pck
MC2.root MC2.pck
DATA.root 

made by this package
and introduces the plotting capabilities



Example 1:
Lets setup a set of plotting infrastructure consisting of 2 MC
objects  and a data object.

>cd $CMSSW_BASE/src #assumes the files are here 

example1.py shows you how to make a stack plotter and interactively make plots,
it is the simplest possible example

------------
MergedPlotter : merges many contributions to 1 . i.e ZZ-> 4e.,ZZ->4 mu samples in ZZ
HZZFakeRatePlotter: Plotter that inherits from TreePlotter and does everyhting in the CR 
extrapolating the fake rate
Higgs cross sections:ALl the numbers from HXSWG are integrated in the framework.
To read DO:

ipython
from CMGTools.HToZZTo4Leptons.macros.param.HiggsTheory import *
t= HiggsTheory("CMGTools/HToZZTo4Leptons/data/YR_7TeV.json")

result=t.getInterp(126) 

#result holds all information in the python dictionary!
