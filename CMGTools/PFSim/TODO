- comparison between sim and gen jets 

- comparison between sim and reco jets (raw PF jets?)

- need gen particle info on gen jets


gen jet:
	match reco jet 
	match sim  jet 
	


X- HepMCProduct not kept in PFAOD -> cannot use them as benchmark. 	
	can now read GenParticles

- add debug information to simulated particles (ref to mother? eff and resolution factors?)

- make cmg PFJets from gen jets and sim jets 

- speed up python (gen matching?)

- resolution and response plotting macros


- photon creation and absorption?

- overlapping neutral hadrons

- make sure that all stable invisible particles are removed
check code in CMSSW (fastsim?) to get the list


- focus on jet simulation 


- could validate my gen jet clustering on GenParticles, with the one of CMS running on the same collection of gen particles. 



- start with barrel region
need to see what to do with HF (be pragmatic and shoot particles there?) 

- shoot single particles to measure PF thresholds and resolution
set up a gun source here, and a gun cfg
set up python analysis framework to do these measurements 




Start generating the events I need for the WWH analysis. 
	check patrick's slides again to see which processes are needed
	find pythia config for these processes
	HZHA: is it integrated in CMSSW?  -> ask Patrick





POSTPONED: 


- need gen information for the gen jets:
	- flavour of jet initiating partons
	- check scale for each flavour. 
- need to deal with taus 
- check JES before corrections 

- leptons and jets 
	X read gen particles 
	X generic smearing 
	X smear ele and mu: 
		note: pT or energy dependence? 
		eff ele and mu
	decide on how to choose between leptons and jets .


DONE

X - integrate the param sim in this pyanalysis
X - implement simple jet smearing
X - add tree system.
	ok for jets
X- deal with the charge. 
X Can I reuse Patrick's LEP3 samples? 
		X check event format. 
X integrate gen jet clustering in FFW
X see Common sequences - note fix for muons
X Generate more events, like 10000
X- integrate fast jet and make particle jets
	X fastjet integrated and running 
	X need to finalize it
		now writing leafcandidates
		moved to antikt 
		important params implemented
X- fake neutral hadrons 
X - generalize jet clustering producer
	ok now reading a view 
X - write particles to EDM and look at them with ROOT 
X- simple CMS model for all PF particles : efficiency and resolution
X - jet clustering on sim particles
