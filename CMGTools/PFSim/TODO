- make sure that all stable invisible particles are removed
check code in CMSSW (fastsim?) to get the list

- focus on jet simulation 

- define the boundaries between gen and sim. 
do sim in the python for now? 
gen: 
	generator
	gen particles for jets / in fact, THE collection of gen particles.
	gen jets 


X - generalize jet clustering producer
	ok now reading a view 

X - write particles to EDM and look at them with ROOT 

- could validate my gen jet clustering on GenParticles, with the one of CMS running on the same collection of gen particles. 

- deal with the charge. 

X- integrate fast jet and make particle jets
	X fastjet integrated and running 
	X need to finalize it
		now writing leafcandidates
		moved to antikt 
		important params implemented
- start with barrel region
need to see what to do with HF (be pragmatic and shoot particles there?) 

- shoot single particles to measure PF thresholds and resolution
set up a gun source here, and a gun cfg
set up python analysis framework to do these measurements 


X integrate gen jet clustering in FFW
X see Common sequences - note fix for muons

Generate more events, like 10000


MAIN OBJECTIVE NOW!
- write a jet study package.
