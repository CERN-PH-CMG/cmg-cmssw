- make sure that all stable invisible particles are removed
check code in CMSSW (fastsim?) to get the list


- focus on jet simulation 

- need jet clustering

X - write particles to EDM and look at them with ROOT 

- deal with the charge. 

- integrate fast jet and make particle jets
	X fastjet integrated and running 
	need to finalize it

- start with barrel region
need to see what to do with HF (be pragmatic and shoot particles there?) 

- shoot single particles to measure PF thresholds and resolution
set up a gun source here, and a gun cfg
set up python analysis framework to do these measurements 

- write a jet study package. 
	integrate gen jet clustering in FFW
		see Common sequences - note fix for muons
