/// about separate components from which they are composed.

/// Many jet shapes involve ratios or more complicated combinations of
/// different components. E.g. a jet broadening is given by a ratio
///
///     B = (\sum_i p_ti DeltaR_{i,jet}) / (\sum_i p_ti)
///
/// The ShapeWithComponents class provides an interface that allows
/// access not just to the shape but also to the individual
/// components, as well as a mechanism for calculating the components
/// individually and combining them back into the overall shape.  This
/// can be of interest, for example, in pileup subtraction, providing
/// a structure to allow subtraction to be performed automatically on
/// the invidividual components.
