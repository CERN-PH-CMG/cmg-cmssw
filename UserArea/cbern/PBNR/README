Any question? ask Colin.

Installation: 
------------

This code was tested in the prerelease indicated below, but it should work with any CMSSW release more recent than 4_2_5.

scram project CMSSW CMSSW_4_4_0_pre10
cd CMSSW_4_4_0_pre10/src
cmsenv 
addpkg CommonTools/ParticleFlow
cvs co -d cbern/PBNR UserCode/CMG/UserArea/cbern/PBNR
scram b -j 4 

Running 
-------

cd cbern/PBNR/test
cmsRun testPBNR_cfg.py

check the filtering information at the end of the output.
you may also want to draw in root the neutral hadron and photon energy fractions of the PFJets in the resulting file, by doing for example:

Events.Draw("recoPFJets_ak5PFJets__RECO.obj.neutralHadronEnergyFraction()","recoPFJets_ak5PFJets__RECO.obj.pt()>30"
