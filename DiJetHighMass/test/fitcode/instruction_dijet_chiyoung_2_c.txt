=========Additional files============================

These files are needed.

Line 45,46 -> tdrStyle.C -> style definition

Line 5 -> QstarBinned_qg.h -> shape from interpolation method.

This file also requires  "shape_qg.h" file.

Line 6 -> ResonancesCrossSection.h -> Resonance cross section values from theory

Line 49 -> histograms_1p010fbm1.root -> files which has histogram which are made ReadTree_new4.C..

I don't know what macro file Maxime has.. 

But it should work with maxime file. 

However, It shoud have data and MC both in the same file.
Of course, you can change this..

==========What we need to change in this file when there is new histogram file==========

I'll skip contents in pave and labels. 

Line 124, 125, and 126 -> scale factor for data, mc comparison.

Line 127 -> lumi (unit is /pb)

Line 186, 235, 242, 271, 279, 282, 294 ,341, 344, 346, 723 -> change the low dijet mass cut (838 in the attached file) and high dijet mass edge (3854 in the attached file). Line 186 is only for low dijet mass.

You also need to change the range of plots. 
In that case you can do SetRangeUser to find places where you need to change.

You need to change parameters for fits which are explained following section

==========fit function================================
From line 10 ~ 33

from first to last it's for
line10 -> Alternate 4 parameters fit
Line17 -> Default fit
Line24 -> Alternate 3 parameters fit
Line30 -> Alternate 2 parameters fit

Line 186~192 -> fit for QCD
Line 195~201 -> fit for QCD UP
Line 204~210 -> fit for QCD DOWN
Line 271~279 -> fit for default
Line 282~287 -> fit for alternate 4 parameters fit
Line 294~301 -> fit for 3 parameters fit

You can check fit status. change the parameters until you get converged status.

from top you will see 
QCD -> QCD up-> QCD down-> default -> default -> 4parameter -> 3parameter

==========11 plots============

This file makes 11 plots. 

All these plots are made for some purpose. 

Once you see the plots you will know what they are for.

c1 -> DijetMass Cross Section with default Fit
c2 -> DijetMass Cross Section with All Fit
c3 -> DijetMass cross section with Fit and QCD MC
c4 -> Data/MC
c5 -> Dijet mass cross section with the signals
c6 -> (Data-Fit)/Fit
c7 -> (Data-Fit)/Error
c8 -> (Data-Fit)/Fit for the All Fits
c9 -> (Data-Fit)/Error the All Fits
c10 -> Data/Fit with the All signal
c11 -> default fit and pull 

===========Error message========

Warning in <ROOT::Math::GSLInterpolator::Integ>: input domain error

This error message was not found with CMSSW 3XX but found with CMSSW 4XX.

It doesn't make any problems in plots or results. 

I didn't spend time to fix this.

============The plots with bands===========

They are made by using THStack.
It's first found at Line 382~386, Then 455~459.

============Resonance shape controll=========

Line 505~629 is for the resonance shape for excited quark and string in differential (cross section vs dijet mass plot)

You don't need to really touch this one but there are some cases you need to take care.

You will see the shape doesn't make sense (sudden drop of high mass tail usually...), and make some error message you didn't see before. 

In this case change the mass range. 

now it's set for 0.6 ~ 1.28 or 1.26. change this values.. usually narrowing helps resoving the problem.
