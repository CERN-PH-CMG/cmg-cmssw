\section{Trigger and event selection}
\label{sec:triggerevselection}

This section summarizes the trigger and tecniques explored for the dilepton event selection in data.
The data and MC samples used are also described.

\subsection{Samples}
\label{subsec:samples}

As detailed in the introduction, all processes which are expected to produce at least one prompt lepton
have to be considered as relevant concurrent processes with the Higgs dileptonic sample. 
Due to the expected hadronic activity resulting from radiation and from the proton remnants,
a second lepton may be mimicked by a mismeasured jet.
This is the case for W+jets production and QCD.
Even if the lepton fake rate is expected to be low, these two processes have large cross sections
when compared with the expected production cross section for the Higgs boson.
Z boson production is however the most important concurrent process
as it produces two prompt leptons in the mass window of interest for this study.
Top quark and di-boson (WW,WZ,ZZ) production are also relevant but with much smaller cross section.
In particular top quark and WW boson production contribute to the non-resonant component of the dilepton spectrum.

Table~\ref{tab:mcsamples} summarizes the simulation samples which are used for all standard model processes
and which may mimick the signal under study.Table~\ref{tab:mcsignalsamples} summarizes the simulation samples used
to model the Higgs signal. Both gluon-gluon and vector boson fusion processes are considered as well as ZZ and WW decays of the Higgs boson.
The global tag START42\_V13 has been used to process \MC with
version 4\_2\_4 of the CMS official software (CMSSW).

\label{subsec:trigrec}

The main aspects of the event selection are summarized as follows:

\begin{description}

%%% TRIGGER
\item[Trigger] unprescaled double lepton triggers available are used.
Unprescaled single muon triggers are also considered in order to recover possible inefficiencies from the trigger system acceptance
for larger values of the pseudo-rapidity ($|\eta|>$2.1).
Whenever possible, trigger thresholds are chosen below the nominal cut used for the offline reconstruction of electrons and muons.
Table~\ref{tab:datatrigger} summarizes the triggers used in data and in the \MC sample.
In the data triggers are vetoed sequentially in order to remove overlaps between the primary datasets~\cite{CMS-TWIKI-PDWG}.

\begin{table}[htp]

%%% PRE-SELECTION
\item[Pre-selection filters] are applied to minimize the contamination from beam-gas interactions, beam-halo and calorimeter noise.
Table~\ref{tab:preselflow} summarizes the number of events in data which are found passing each filter.
It can be seen that the beam halo filter mostly affects the muon sample, as expected, as it is based on the signals
left in the CSC's by halo muons.

%%% PRIMARY VERTICES
\item[Primary vertices] must be found within maximum range of 24~cm along the beam line (z) and within a 2~cm cylinder around the beam line ($\rho$)..
The minimum number of degrees of freedom (n.d.o.f.) of the vertex fit is required to be 4.
In case of multiple primary vertices the primary vertex is chosen has the one with highest flux of charged particles in the transverse plane,
i.e. the vertex with highest $\displaystyle{\sum_{tracks}} p_T^2$ flux.
Fig.~\ref{fig:vertexcontrol} shows two control distributions for the selected vertices in data and in the simulation:
the vertex multiplicity and the transverse momentum resulting from the sum of all the charged particle flow candidates which are associated to the primary vertex of the event.
Overall a fair agreement is found between data and \MC but it is visible that the procedure used to re-weight the pileup in the simulation
does not reproduce fully the real pileup scenario which evolved throughout different stages during the 2011 run data taking.
The sum of the charged particle flow candidates associated to the primary vertex is a quantity which is expected to be robust against pileup variations
and which shows sensitivity to processes in which undetectable particles are produced such as : $W$, top quark and di-boson production.
In both distributions the \MC does not include the low mass Drell-Yan contribution which contributes to an overall scale-factor of $\approx$ 10\%.

%%% LEPTONS
\item[Leptons] leptons (electrons or muons) are required to be reconstructed with at least $p_T>$5~GeV/c and $|\eta|<$2.5 (2.4) for electrons (muons). 

Electrons can be seeded from either the electromagnetical calorimeter (ECAL driven) or the tracker (tracker driven).
Electrons reconstructed in the ECAL barrel to endcap transition are not considered for this study in order to reduce the contamination from fakes and to 
minimize the impact of mismeasurement of the lepton energies which translates to a mismeasurement of the missing transverse energy of the event.
The impact parameter of the electron track is required to be consistent with prompt production from the beam spot within $|d_0|<$0.04~cm.
Non-prompt electrons, from photon conversions in the tracker material, are vetoed by geometric requirements
applied on partner tracks (dist$<$0.02~cm and $\Delta\cot\theta<$0.02) and by requiring a maximum of 1 lost tracker hit. 
For each electron it is also required that no tracker or global muon with at least 10 tracker hits is found within a $\Delta R<$0.1 of the reconstructed electron.
Electron identification relies on a simple cut based identification algorithm 
which depends on the supercluster shape, its alignment with the track which is associated to electron and H/E.
The electron-id cuts are tuned specifically for each ECAL region (barrel and endcap) in order to yield 
an expected efficiency for the reconstruction of electrons from $W\rightarrowe\nu$ decays.
Details on the VBTF specific requirements can be found in~\cite{CMS-TWIKI-VBTF11}.
For this study we require at pre-selection that the VBTF-95 working point is verified. 
For electron candidates to be considered as a leg of the dilepton candidate the verification of the VBTF-85 working point is further required
as well as having $p_T>$20~GeV/c. 
The choice on these electron-ids is trigger oriented, as the trigger identification requirements consist in looser versions of the VBTF requirements.

Muon identification is mainly based on the $\chi^2$ fit of the global track and on the number of hits in the tracker and muon stations.
Loose muons are required to verify the TrackerMuonArbitrated criteria, i.e. to be tracker muons, 
and to be consistent with prompt production from the beam spot within $|d_0|<$0.02~cm.
Basic tracker quality requirements are also imposed, namely that : $\chi^2/ndof<$10 and at least 11 tracker hits are used for the inner track fit.
In order to be considered as a leg of the dilepton candidate the muons are furthermore required 
to have 1 hit in the muon chambers and to verify the TMLastStationAngTight arbitration and have $p_T>$20~GeV.

The leptons from signal are expected to be well isolated in the event.
The isolation can be quantified relatively to the transverse momentum of the lepton by
sum of the momenta of the particles reconstructed in a cone of $\Delta R<0.3$ built around the lepton candidate.
The following measurement of the relative isolation is used, $I_{rel}$:

\begin{equation}
I_{rel}=\frac{I_{photons}+I_{neutral~hadrons}+I_{charged~hadrons}}{p_T}
\label{eq:reliso}
\end{equation}

where each $I$ represents the sum of the transverse momenta of the photons, neutral hadrons and charged hadrons reconstructed inside the isolation cone.
Loose electrons and muons are required to have $I_{rel}<$0.5. 
Electrons or muons are considered as legs of the dilepton candidate if they have $I_{rel}<0.1$.
In App.~\cite{sec:app:leptonisolation} the lepton isolation is discussed in further detail.


%%% DILEPTON
\item[Dilepton] for each event with at least 2 leptons selected in the previous conditions all dilepton pair candidates are examined.
The dilepton candidate is required to have an invariant mass compatible with a $Z$ boson decay, i.e. $|M-M_Z|<$15~GeV/c$^2$
and in case of ambiguity the pair with highest $\sum p_T$ is chosen.
No requirement is made on the charge of the leptons.
The reconstructed dilepton mass in an enlarged $Z$ boson acceptance window 
and the angle made by the two leptons in the transverse plane ($\Delta\phi$) is shown in Fig~\ref{fig:dileptoncontrol}.

\begin{figure}[htp]

\label{fig:dileptoncontrol}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

In order to reduce the contamination from multilepton events, produced from WZ and ZZ decays,
events are vetoed if containing another loosely selected electron or muon as described above.
The loose selection applied on the third lepton is expected to have a high efficiency for signal events($>$99.8\% for both channels).
The remainder of WZ and ZZ events are mostly due to fully hadronic decays of one of the vector bosons or to the decay of a Z boson to neutrinos.
A slight excess of events with more than 2 muons is observed in data as shown in Fig~\ref{fig:thirdleptonveto}
most probably related to a higher lepton fake rate than the one modelled by the \MC.
Notice also that at this point no data-driven correction for the lepton efficiencies has been applied to correct further the \MC.

%%% JETS
\item[Jets] are reconstructed with the anti-$k_T$ algorithm with a cone of $R=0.5$ are selected with $p_T>$15~GeV/c and $|\eta|<5.0$.
The loose jet id used to select the jets is based on the electromagnetic fraction of the jets among other variables. 
The jet multiplicity distribution obtained after the dilepton selection is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:jetmult} for jets found inside the tracker acceptance region only.
A good agreement is found between data and \MC prediction.

\begin{figure}[htp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{img/mumu_njets}
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{img/ee_njets}
\caption{Jet multiplicity distribution in di-muon ({\em left}) and di-electron ({\em right}).}
\label{fig:jetmult}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Jets with $|\eta|>$2.4 are used for analysis but not for for jet counting. In the forward region due to the limited acceptance of the tracker
no jet-vertex association is possible, and therefore, the contamination from pileup may become non negligible.
The effect can be estimated from simulation by considering the average jet multiplicity in $Z\rightarrow ll$ events
as a function of the generated pileup with and without the tracker acceptance requirement imposed.
The evolution of the average jest multiplicity as function of the pileup is shown in Fig~\ref{fig:jetmultvspu}, {\em left}.
We conclude that by restricting the acceptance of the jets used for counting to within the tracker acceptance region
minimizes the dependence on pileup, even if a small increase in the average multiplicity is expected.
The ratio of the multiplicity of two consecutive jet bins (e.g. $R_k=N_k/N_{k+1}$ with $k$=1,2,...),  
can also be used to evaluate the expected stability of jet counting
against the variation of the pileup scenario in data. In an ideal pileup-less scenario it is expected 
that $R_k$ is constant reflecting a ``staircase''-like jet multiplicity in $Z\rightarrow ll$ events.
This structure results from the fact that the jets are mainly generated from initial state radiation (ISR).
The distributions for different $R_k$ are shown in Fig~\ref{fig:jetmultvspu}, {\em right}.
It is observed that restricting  the acceptance of the jets for counting to the tracker acceptance region
stabilizes the value of $R_k$ independently of the pileup scenario, yielding a jet multiplicity
closer to the ideal ``staircase'' distribution where $R_k=$cte.
For processes where jets are generated from decays with flux of color or where jets accompany the fusion of heavy objects
like W/Z vector bosons (i.e. VBF processes), $R_k$ is no longer constant and reflects a ``Poisson''-like jet multiplicity~\cite{Englert:2011pq}.
As the VBF signature constitutes, per se, a distinct production process of the Higgs boson, it is important
to identify correctly this transition in the jet multiplicity by reducing the contamination from pileup.
VBF jets will also tend to be forward motivating the usage of jets reconstructed at high pseudo-rapidty.
These arguments support our choice to count jets inside the tracker acceptance region only
and used jets at higher $\eta$ regions for the purpose of identifying VBF like processes. 
The VBF specific selection will be discussed in more detail in Sec.~\ref{sec:higgssearch}.

\begin{figure}[htp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{img/dy_jetmultvspu}
\caption{Evolution of the average jet multiplicity ({\em left}) and the ratio of consecutive jet multiplicity bins ({\em right})
as function of the generated pileup in $Z\rightarrow ll$ events. 
Two cases are superimposed on each plot for comparison: 
jets in the central region ($|\eta|<$2.4) and all reconstructed jets ($|\eta|<$5.0).}
\label{fig:jetmultvspu}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

In order to reduce the contamination from processes which produce heavy flavor jets such as \ttbar, single top, vector boson + heavy quarks production, b-tagging algorithms are used.
The jet-B probability (JBP) and the simple secondary vertex high efficiency (SSVHE) taggers are used for this purpose. 
Details of these algorithms and their performance can be found in~\cite{CMS-PAS-BTV-11-002}. The JBP algorithm is chosen
as it is expected to provide the highest efficiency in \ttbar events for a mistag rate of 10\% (loose working point).
The SSVHE tagger is used to complement the JBP tagger as it is designed for higher purity of $b$-jet identification and can therefore
increase the $b$-tagging efficiency without leading to a significant increase of the mistag rate. 
Events with a jet with $p_T>$30~GeV/c, tagged with the loose working point of the JBP algorithm or with the medium working point of the SSVHE algorithm, are rejected. 
This choice is made after optimizing the efficiency of the rejection of the top contribution as summarized in Tab.~\ref{tab:btagoptim}.
Fig.~\ref{fig:btagging} shows the b-tag multiplicity distributions observed in di-muon and di-electron events using the combination of taggers just described.
A good agreement, within 10-15\% is found between data and \MC taking into account that at this point no data-driven correction scale factors for the $b$-tag and mistag rates have been applied.
The level of discrepancy observed is in fact compatible with the $\approx$ 10\% scale factor measured for the mistag rate~\cite{CMS-PAS-BTV-11-002}.
The usage of the data-derived scale factors for the $b$-tagging algorithms will be discussed in more detail in Sec.~\ref{subsec:systunc}.

%%% VBF
\item[Vector Boson Fusion]:  The identification of the events produced via Vector Boson Fusion (VBF) is based on the presence in the event of two leading jets in the forward regions of with an invariant mass of at least $450~GeV/c$ and a $\Delta\eta$-gap$>3.5$.
In addition, these two jets must not be identified as b-jets.
In order to reduce the potential impact of the pile-up on, only jets with $p_T>30~GeV/c$ are considered.
Presence of additional jets ($p_T>15~GeV/c$) in the tracker acceptance is also forbidden.
Finally, the two legs of the dilepton must be conained between the two leading jets.
Fig.~\ref{fig:vbfdEta} shows the distribution of the $\eta$-gap between the two VBF jets while Fig.~\ref{fig:vbfiMass} shows the distribution of the invariant mass between the two VBF jets.  The Fig.~\ref{fig:vbfeventflow} shows the impact of each cuts on the signal and on the different backgrounds.

%%% MET
\item[Missing transverse energy] particle flow based \MET is used. The \MET is built from the vectorial sum of the transverse momentum all particle flow reconstructed candidates.
The verification of the reconstruction of the missing transverse energy will be the subject of a detailed discussion in Sec.~\ref{sec:met}
and a specific \MET based selection will be proposed to reduce more efficienctly the contamination from $Z$ events with minimal contamination from pileup.
Fig.~\ref{fig:metcontrol} shows the distribution for the \MET after the $b$-jet veto has been applied. 
A wider resolution is observed in data with respect to the \MC prediction reinforcing the need to develop a detailed verification of its reconstruction
and a data-driven method to model the expected performance to remove $Z$ events.

\section{Verification of the reconstructed missing transverse energy}
\label{sec:met}

The following section we discuss different strategies adopted in the choice of the variable used to reduce the contamination
from the instrumental background, i.e., from processes in which the \MET is mismeasured.
The main sources of mis-measurement of this quantity are the underestimate of the hadronic recoil
of $Z$ bosons, due to jet energy scale and resolution as well as detector acceptance,
and the contamination from pileup.
In the first part we describe a variable developed with the purpose of reducing the error in the estimate of the hadronic recoil of the $Z$ bosons.
The performance of this variable is compared with standard \MET among others.
In the second part we describe the strategies developed to verify the contamination from pileup events with high hadronic activity.

\subsection{Description of the reduced \MET method}
\label{subsec:redmet}

We adopt the definition of reduced missing transverse energy (\RMET) for our analysis.
The definiton is an upgrade of the original concept developed by the D0 collaboration~\cite{Abazov:2008yf}.
In this method the recoil of the dilepton is decomposed using either the dilepton:

\begin{itemize}
\item direction, in case the two leptons are collimated, i.e. $\Delta\phi^{ll}<\pi/2$;
\item bisector, in case the two leptons are reconstructed with an open angle, i.e.   $\Delta\phi^{ll}>\pi/2$;
\end{itemize}

In the case of two leptons reconstructed with an open angle 
the bisector of the dilepton is defined transversely to the axis which maximizes the dilepton transverse momentum,  i.e. the thrust axis($\vec{t}$):

\begin{equation}
\vec{t} =\frac{1}{|\vec{l}_1-\vec{l}_2|}(\vec{l}_1 - \vec{l}_{2})
\label{eq:thrust} 
\end{equation}

where $l_1$ ($l_2$) is the 3-momentum of the leading (trailer) lepton. 
We adopt the convention to define the bisector ($\vec{b}$) as pointing in the same direction as the leading lepton, i.e.:

\begin{equation}
\vec{b}\cdot\vec{t}=0 ~~~\wedge~~~ \vec{b}\cdot\vec{l}_1>0
\label{eq:bisector} 
\end{equation}

The thrust and bisector are used to define the projections of the dilepton recoil which can be estimated from two sources:

\begin{itemize}
\item clustered recoil ($\vec{R}^{\text{clust}}$), from the jets reconstructed in the event;
\item unclustered recoil ($\vec{R}^{\text{uncl}}$), from the sum of all particle flow candidates with the exception of the two leptons;
\end{itemize}

Originally the \RMET variable is computed with the following prescriptions:

\begin{enumerate}
\item the jets which contribute to each component of $\vec{R}^{\text{clust}}$ have to be found in the opposite direction with respect to the correspondent dilepton projection  
\item likewise the projections of the unclustered recoil are considered to be 0 if pointing in the same direction as the correspondent dilepton projection
\item the estimate of the recoil along each direction is made conservatively by taking the minimum of the two estimate, i.e. $R_i = \min \{ R_i^{\text{clust}},R_i^{\text{uncl}} \}$ 
\end{enumerate}

In this study we argue that 1. and 2. should not be used as they lead to an incomplete description of the recoil of the dilepton system for both instrumental background
(i.e. $Z$ events) and signal events.
In the first case the prescription to use jets which point in the opposite direction of the dilepton is compromised by the ocurrence of jet production
in the underlying event or even by multiple interaction. If only a subset of the jets is accounted for this leads inevitably to a wrong estimate of the true recoil.
In the second case we argue that highly boosted Higgs will be measured with the two Z's in the same hemisphere and therefore both the dilepton and the \MET will be pointing in the same direction
and found to be recoiling against a jet system. For these topologies the recoil will be estimated as being 0, leading to a consequent inefficiency of identifying the signal at high values of \RMET.
Instead we define \RMET from the minimum imbalance found using either the clustered or the unclustered recoil of the system.
Each component of \RMET is computed and minimized individually as

\begin{equation}
{\rm red-}\cancel{E}_{T_i}^{k} =\vec{p}_{T}^{ll}\cdot \vec{i} + \alpha R^{\text{k}}_{i}
\label{eq:rmet}
\end{equation}

where k=clustered/unclustered and $\alpha$ is a scale factor which we consider always to be 1.
The absolute \RMET measurement is taken from the quadratic sum of the two components.
The procedure just described assumes a conservative scenario for jet energy and unclustered \MET reconstruction and resolution.
It is also expected to be effective against pileup events as jets are seeded using particle flow candidates associated to the primary vertex selected for each event. 
Our definition of \RMET is compared with the original one from D0 in Fig.~\ref{fig:redmet} for di-muon events.
It can be seen that the D0 definition yields a distribution with a very good resolution but which artificially 
accumulates events with \RMET=0 even for the signal. This result is strictly related to the topology of the boosted Higgs events
and can be mostly identified from events with 1 or 2 jets.
It can also be observed a better agreement between data and \MC for the definition of \RMET adopted by us.

The \RMET variable is adopted in the event selection for the Higgs boson and
two working points (medium and tight) are defined in order to reject the instrumental background ($Z$ events) at a 10$^3$ and 10$^4$ rate level.
The medium (tight) working point is used as a base selection for medium (high) mass search corresponding to 200-300 ($>$300) GeV/c$^2$.
The working points are defined independently for each jet multiplicity bin in order to maximize the rejection power of the instrumental background
\footnote{The working points are obtained from a parameterization of the efficiency curves where the efficiency
is defined from the fraction of events of a given process observed above a given threshold.
The parametrization used is a 2$^{nd}$ order polynomial function of the logarithm of the \RMET cut.}.
Table~\ref{tab:redmetwp} summarizes the values adopted for the medium and tight \RMET working points.

The performance of the \RMET can be further quantified relatively to the standard \MET measurement 
as well as other \MET related variables. The \MET measurement can be made more robust against pileup contamination
by considering the minimum of two transverse momenta sums: of all particle flow candidates (\MET) or of all 
charged particle flow candidates which can be associated to the primary vertex of the event (\tkMET).
This variable was introduced in Section~\ref{subsec:trigrec} to characterize the properties of the primary vertex.
As it is built using a vertex constraint it is expected to have a small contamination from pileup.
It's resolution is however degraded and has a non trivial dependence on the topology of the event,
therefore the minimum is taken with respect to the full \MET measurement.
A third variable which is worth comparing to is the projected missing transverse energy (\projMET)
which aims at minimizing the poor reconstruction of leptons.
Even if this is not considered to be the main problem affecting the \MET measurement under the $Z$ boson peak
we compare its performance with the other measurements.
This variable is computed as the transverse component of \MET 
relatively to the closest lepton (if closer than $\pi/2$ in the azimuthal angle)
or the full \MET otherwise
\footnote{\projMET can be explicitly written from the following formulas.
Let $\delta\phi^{\rm min}=\min\{\delta\phi(E_{T}^{miss},l^1),\delta\phi(E_{T}^{miss},l^2)\}$
be the azimuthal angle between the \MET vector and the transverse momentum of the closest lepton.
Then \projMET=\MET$\cdot\sin\delta\phi^{\rm min}$ if $\delta\phi^{\rm min}<\pi/2$ or \MET, otherwise.}.
Following the prescription adopted by~\cite{CMS-PAS-HIG-11-003}
the dependency on pile-up is reduced by taking the minimum \projMET computed from \MET and \tkMET.
This minimization exploits further the correlation between both estimates in signal and 
uncorrelation otherwise, as in Drell-Yan events.
Fig.~\ref{fig:metperformances} summarize the performance of each variable 
for the rejection of the instrumental background considering two hypothetical higgs boson masses.
The performance is compared for events selected under the $Z$ boson peak and in the side-band region, i.e.
dilepton events with a mass compreehended in the 61-76 and 106-121 GeV/c$^2$ range.
It is visible that the \RMET approach is performing better overall in the $Z$ boson peak region which is the region of interest for our study.
The performance of the \RMET variable is significantly better in the low mass regime under the $Z$ mass peak.

\end{center}
\end{figure}

The performances can be further compared in terms of robustness against the variation of the pileup scenario.
This test is summarized in Fig~\ref{fig:metperformancevspileup}. 
We conclude that all approaches have a dependency on the pileup scenario which is minimized when taking
the \tkMET or \RMET approaches. The dependency for these pseudo-\MET variables is observed to be approximately linear
in both the average and RMS of the spectrum.

In the next sub-section we discuss further strategies which are still subject of on-going studies which attempt 
to minimize further the dependence of these variables against pileup.

\subsection{Strategies adopted to minimize the effect of pileup}
\label{subsec:pueffects}

In the previous section it was noticed that by taking the minimum for each event of the \MET measurement and the \tkMET measurement
we can obtain an estimate of the \MET which is more robust against the contamination from pileup.
The drawback of this approach is the lost of resolution in the measurement as \tkMET uses only the charged component of the event
which can be measured up to a pseudo-rapidity of $|\eta|<$2.5 due to the limited acceptance of the tracker.
However for the signal we're interested in we expect that the neutrinos are indeed emitted in the central region of the detector
and therefore we expect a correlation between \MET measured using the information from the full detector and \MET measured using the central region.
For instrumental background this is not the case any longer, as depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:metandtkmet}.
Therefore we explore in this section a strategy to control further the measurement of \MET using the central part of the CMS detector only.

\section{Search for the standard model Higgs in the 2l2$\nu$ final state}
\label{sec:higgssearch}

The next Sections describe three complementary approaches to search for the standard model Higgs in the 2l2$\nu$ final state.
The analysis relies fully on the expected behavior for the Higgs events as described in the simulation.
The transverse momentum of the Higgs boson is however corrected for the NNLO+NNLL 
prediction which are not taken into account by the \POWHEG sample used in this study.
The Higgs-$p_T$ reweighting is applied only to gluon-gluon fusion and it is described in more detail in~\cite{CMS-TWIKI-GEN-higgspt}

Two of the analysis proposed are cut-based and a third one is a discriminator based analysis implemented using the TMVA package~\cite{Hocker:2007ht}.
For each analysis the events are categorized according to the jet multiplicity observed.
Events with $\geq$2~jets are furthermore analyzed to search for the vector-boson-fusion (VBF) specific signature.
If the event does not meet the VBF specific selection it is accounted for in the $\geq$2~jets bin.

\subsection{Higgs event selection using a cut-based analysis approach}
\label{subsec:higgsselection}

The selection variables chosen for the search of the Higgs boson production in the gg$\rightarrow$H mode are summarized in Tab.~\ref{tab:gluglucuts}.
The cuts were chosen by maximing the following figure of merit $f=S/\sqrt(S+B)$ after requiring that the instrumental $Z$ background is reduced by a 10$^{-3}$ (medium \RMET working point).
Tor the different mass points signal includes, as in the previous sections, the gluon-gluon and vector boson fusion processes, as well as Higgs decays in both the ZZ and WW channels.
Background includes all the remaining processes after the \RMET cut as listed in Table~\ref{tab:mcsamples}.
The details on the $f$ variable can be found in Sec.~\ref{sec:app:cutbasedoptimization}.
Table~\ref{tab:gluglucuts} summarizes the selection applied as a function of the Higgs mass being searched.

\subsubsection{Data-driven estimation of the instrumental background}
\label{subsubsec:instrumentalbackground}

We use isolated photon candidates to model the instrumental background.
We study the jet multiplicity and scaling properties of these events
in order to better reproduce the ones expected in $Z$ boson production.
The study is separated in two regimes where two different jet multiplicity scaling properties are expected
and which correspond to the gluon-gluon and VBF productions of the Higgs boson.
The approach followed is summarized below and has been recently proposed by~\cite{Englert:2011pq}.

Photon candidates are selected from dedicated photon triggered samples.
The samples are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:instrbckgdatasamples}.

\begin{table}[htp]
\begin{center}
\caption{\MC and data samples analyzed for the estimation of the instrumental background.
For data the total integrated luminosity and the run range analyzed are shown.
For \MC the the cross section and the corresponding integrated luminosity of the analyzed sample are shown.

For each triggered event the highest $p_T$ photon trigger candidate is chosen.
The offline reconstructed photon is required to have a $E_T$ 
greater than that of the trigger threshold it fired.
Further identification and isolation requirements are made as summarized in Table~\ref{tab:photonsel}
and are based on~\cite{Khachatryan:2010fm}.

\section{Appendix: Lepton isolation}
\label{sec:app:leptonisolation}

In this section we focus on two specific aspects affecting the determination of lepton isolation efficiency:
the contamination from pileup and the differences between leptons in the $Z\rightarrow ll$ sample and in the Higgs sample.

The presence of pileup is expected to contribute to the degradation of the isolation, especially 
through the neutral particles which cannot be associated to the vertex.
The deviation introduced in the isolation by the average energy density deposition in the detector from pileup
can be estimated using the $\rho$-parameter computed using the fast jet algorithm~\cite{Cacciari:2007fd}.
As the average values for $\rho$, $I_{photons}$ and $I_{neutral~hadrons}$ are expected to increase differently as a function of the number of pileup events
a linear parameterization can be derived for each case and used to correct the isolation in average.
The results of these parameterizations are shown for in Fig~\ref{fig:isolprofile} for a simulated sample of $Z\rightarrow \mu\mu$.
The width of the distributions of the previous variables is also affected by the pileup and in the case of the $\rho$ a non-linear behavior is observed.
In this study we choose therefore not to perform any correction for the isolation based on the pileup contamination as estimated from 
the $\rho$ parameter due to the fact that events with large fluctuations of $\rho$ can lead to overcorrections of the lepton isolation leading to an increase
of the contamination from non-isolated lepton candidates.
The slope of the isolation profile is used to assign a systematic uncertainty on the isolation efficiency of 0.8\%
for both electrons and muons.

\begin{figure}[htp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{img/muonIsolationProfile}
\caption{

The average (RMS) of the distributions is shown as function of the number of generated pileup events on the {\em left} ({\em right}).}
\label{fig:isolprofile}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The efficiency of the isolation requirement is determined from data using the tag-and-probe method.
This method relies on the kinematics of $Z\rightarrow ll$ events which may differ slightly from the kinematics
of the signal, i.e. $H\rightarrow VV\rightarrow 2l2\nu$. The difference is not expected to be observed in the absolute isolation of the leptons
as the jet activity is not substantially different and as the pileup conditions are similar.
However, as the $p_T$ distribution of the leptons is different, being the leptons from $Z$ events usually softer, 
a difference arises in the relative isolation, as the ratio of the absolute isolation to the $p_T$ of each lepton is considered.
This effect is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:zvshlepkinematics} where the $p_T$, absolute isolation and relative isolation
of the leptons matched to the decays of the Z bosons are compared. 
From this study we conclude that the efficiency of the relative isolation in $\mu\mu$ ($ee$) events is 0.8\% (0.5\%) smaller in Higgs events with respect to $Z$ events. 
Therefore we assign this number as a systematic uncertainty on the efficiency computed from data using the tag-and-probe method.

\section{Appendix: Cut based optimization}
\label{sec:app:cutbasedoptimization}

In this section we summarize the procedure adopted to optimized the selection of the cut based analysis for the search for Higgs boson.
A simple approach has been taken by considering three variables which show discriminating power for the Higgs signal.
These variables are:

\begin{description}
\item[$\delta\phi^{ll}$] - the azimuthal angle between the two leptons that constitute the dilepton candidate. The angle is expected to be significantly smaller for final state leptons from Higgs with large mass;
\item[\RMET (longitudinal)] - the longitudinal component of \RMET. This specific projection is expected to show the sensitivity to events in which the two Z bosons from the Higgs decay are recoiling against each other.
For low mass Higgs, the production of extra jets, might however lead to a boost of the overall system in which both Z's can be produced along the same hemisphere. 
In these boosted topologies the longitudinal component of \RMET is expected to point along the dilepton direction;
\item[$\sum M_{T}(l^i,E_{T}^{miss})$] - the sum of the transverse mass of each lepton with the \MET vector. This variable is chosen as no full mass reconstruction is possible in the final state under study.
The full transverse mass of the system could be used but by requiring both the dilepton and the \MET source to be the same, i.e., a $Z$ boson, introduces an artificial kinematic limit on all backgrounds.;
\end{description}

The  variables used to define a loose selection region where the presence of signal is more significative, i.e. where $f=S/\sqrt{S+B}$ is maximized.
As tighter selections also lead to a depletion of signal, the cuts are selected in the rising edge of the $f$ variable.
Fig.~\ref{fig:varcutopt} summarizes the distributions obtained for the $f$ variable after requiring that the instrumental
background is reduced by 10$^{-3}$ (medium working point for \RMET selection, as defined in Sec.~\ref{subsec:redmet}.
Although differences are found between different jet multiplicity bins, they are not considered to tune further the cuts,
as the $f$-curves show similar rising edges. Therefore, inclusive selection cuts are chosen.
